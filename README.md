# Normal-Equations
The normal equations are the closed form solution to least squares problems. They are a system of linear equations used to obtain the least squares solution to an overdetermined linear system. This report will cover the background of linear least squares and data fitting, how the normal equation are derived and used, the drawbacks of the normal equations, applications for least squares problems and th enormal equations, and the history of th enormal equations.
